# Assignment 2 (50%, group):

Working Recommender System Prototype (accompanied by 2500 words report max., excl. cover sheet, table of contents, references, and appendices; DEADLINE: Monday week 9: March 31st 2024, before 9:00 am) and presentation. 

For this assignment, you will work in groups of 4-5 students. The challenge is to develop a recommender system with a working interface for a public broadcaster that you can choose from the cases discussed in the course (e.g., NPO, PBS, ZDF). You will need to balance and implement different public values based on each group member’s previous proposal in assignment 1. You will need to find a solution that balances different stakeholders' needs and values. For the recommender system, you will need to create fictional user data that you combine with the content data that is already available. You will need to decide what metrics can help with providing accurate recommendations that are in line with the values that you intend to support with your system. 

It is important to include a critical reflection on how you chose to integrate and balance different public values in your design. It is up to you how you want to structure your report, but it should address the following points: 

- An introduction to the context, stakeholders, relevant (public) values, and objectives of the recommender system. 
- Definitions for (public) values and a logical as well as transparent operationalisation in the recommender system (both in the algorithm “under the hood” and the interface). 
- An explanation of the motivations that informed specific choices about the design of the recommender system. 

The final report requires you to combine knowledge from the three pillars (conceptual, design, technical) in one holistic project. 

You will also present your work during the seminar sessions in week 8. The presentations account for 25% of the overall grade for assignment 2! 

Assessment forms for both assignments will be made available in advance. APA-style referencing (or a similar system such as Harvard or Chicago) MUST be applied for all written assignments! You also need to share your code with the lecturers in a fitting format (.py or .ipynb).
